conert mile&lt;->km , inch&lt;->cm , fahrenheit &lt;-> celsius
Introduction
You should develop a simple hybrid application that provides the user with a simple converter he can use when converting miles <-> km, inch <-> cm and fahrenheit <-> celsius  (at the minimum). The main screen should include a list of the conversion possibilities. Selecting a possibility the user should be taken to the screen on which he can convert.
